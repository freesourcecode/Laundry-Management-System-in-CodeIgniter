# Laundry Management System Project in CodeIgniter

The **Laundry Management Syste**m is primarily used to keep track of numerous services.

In addition, the system displays all records along with their particular details. The system allows for the insertion of expenses.

An administrator has the authority to manage both staff and customers. Employee and customer records are required for the system to work properly.

The administrative component of the laundry service’s transactions is covered in the transaction section. The administrator must fill out various fields prior to submitting the form.

Customer and worker information is stored in those fields.

The admin must pick available personnel and customers, as well as enter laundry weight, order, and finish date, in order to manage transactions.

Once all information is set, the system will automatically charge a fixed amount based on their respective weights.
